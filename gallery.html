            <h2>Welcome to My Art Gallery</h2>
            <p>Explore a collection of images that showcase my artistic journey and creativity.<br>
               Each artwork here is more than just lines and color <br>
                it's a piece of emotion, a moment captured through hand and heart.
            From powerful mythological figures like Mahakal and Adipurush to soft portraits of loved ones,<br>
                every sketch tells a unique story.<br>
          I use pens, pencils, and markers to express what words sometimes cannot.<br>
         This is a space where creativity meets calm, <br>
                and every visitor is part of the journey.<br>
         Thank you for stepping into my world of art. üé®üñ§<br>
